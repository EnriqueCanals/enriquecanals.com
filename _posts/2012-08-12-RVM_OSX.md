##Step 1:
Install xCode 4.4+ from Apple or your desired source and install cmd line tools.

If upgrading from a previous version of OS X, update the location of xCode:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
{% endhighlight %}

##Step 2:
Install XQuartz (not included in xCode or 10.8 anymore):

<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X112.7.2>

This will require you to logout and re-login in after install.

##Step 3:
Install Homebrew into /usr/local:

It has been recommended to create the folder '/usr/local/Cellar' before hand, due to some bug on homebrew. Once you've done that:

{% highlight bash %}
ruby -e '$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)'
{% endhighlight %}

_or_

{% highlight bash %}
ruby <(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)
{% endhighlight %}

Now make sure you can write into /usr/local/Cellar where homebrew installs everything, so:

{% highlight bash %}
chown -R $USER /usr/local/Cellar
{% endhighlight %}

##Step 4:
Install RVM from home directory:

{% highlight bash %}
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
{% endhighlight %}

Then reload your shell with RVM.

{% highlight bash %}
source /Users/<user_name>/.rvm/scripts/rvm
{% endhighlight %}

To see the requirements for your system:

{% highlight bash %}
rvm requirements
{% endhighlight %}

On my fresh OS X 10.8 install I was instructed by RVM to do the following:

{% highlight bash %}
brew update
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
brew tap homebrew/dupes
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
brew install autoconf automake apple-gcc42
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
rvm pkg install openssl
{% endhighlight %}

##Step 5:
Install Ruby 1.9.3:

{% highlight bash %}
rvm install 1.9.3
{% endhighlight %}

If you've followed the setps above then you should be fine to continue from here.

##Step 6:
Set Ruby 1.9.3 as the system default:

{% highlight bash %}
rvm use ruby-1.9.3
{% endhighlight %}

##Step 7:
Changing the default shell in OS X (bash) to zShell (zsh)

{% highlight bash %}
brew install zsh
{% endhighlight %}

Verify your path at this point, though it should be /usr/local/bin/zsh if you followed the instructions above on a clean Mountain Lion install.

Now run:

{% highlight bash %}
chsh
{% endhighlight %}

After you'll be asked to enter your root password which will then open the default editor within your shell window.

Once inside edit the line labeled 'Shell' to match your path to zsh

{% highlight bash %}
Open Directory: /Local/Default

Shell: /bin/zsh

Full Name: MasterControl

Office Location:

Office Phone:

Home Phone:
{% endhighlight %}

Save the file and reopen your terminal.
