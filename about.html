	<p>
		This site was created to log my thoughts on the things that interest me and also to encourage discourse with others.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have worked on some interesting projects in the past and I'm constantly looking for new and challenging problems to solve.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm an enthusiast of open source and free software and try to contribute to projects whenever possible. I'm currently the maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/MarioRicalde/SCSS.tmbundle">SCSS Syntax Bundle</a> package for TextMate, Sublime Text and Atom.
